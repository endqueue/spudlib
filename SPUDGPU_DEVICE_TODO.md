# SpudGPU adapters and devices TODO

Written on 2026-10-21; the header section agreed and implemented the same
day, in `spudgpu.h` and all three backends.

**State (2026-10-22):**

- Metal: built on macOS (Apple M5 Pro), Debug and Release.
  `tests/spudgpu_device_test` (new) passes, plain and under the `-asan` and
  `-tsan` presets; the seven samples the Metal build has ran 120 frames each
  in a Debug build, with the live-object check on (2026-10-21).
- D3D12 and Vulkan: run on Windows on 2026-10-22. Every SpudGPU sample ran
  on D3D12 (both devices and WARP) and on Vulkan (both devices), under
  validation. That found two Vulkan bugs, fixed in `c3cf5f7`: an image
  barrier out of `UNDEFINED` or `PRESENT_SRC` started at the top or bottom
  of the pipe, not chained to the acquire semaphore's wait; and
  `drawIndirectFirstInstance` was never enabled, now
  `SPUDGPU_FEATURE_DRAW_INDIRECT_FIRST_INSTANCE`.
- Every caller is converted (`../SPUDGPU_DEVICE_MIGRATION.md`, 2026-10-22).

The rest of this file is the design as agreed, kept as the record of why.

`spudgpu_enumerate_devices` both lists the GPUs and creates a device on every
one of them. Every graphics API SpudGPU translates keeps those apart (Vulkan's
`vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices` / `vkCreateDevice`, DXGI's `EnumAdapters1` /
`D3D12CreateDevice`, WebGPU's `requestAdapter` / `requestDevice`), and this
splits them the same way: an **adapter** says what a GPU is and can do and
costs nothing to list; a **device** is created on one, by the caller, with the
features and queues the caller asks for.

## What is wrong now

- **A device on every GPU, made for the caller.** The first
  `spudgpu_enumerate_devices` creates a logical device (and on Vulkan the
  bindless table) on every GPU the API lists. On a laptop with an integrated
  and a discrete GPU that powers up the discrete one, and on Vulkan each
  device costs driver memory and threads, whichever one the caller then uses.
- **Features switched on by SpudGPU, not the caller.** Vulkan enables
  features at `vkCreateDevice`, and the backend enables everything it finds
  (`shaderOutputLayer`, `depthBiasClamp`, `independentBlend`,
  `multiDrawIndirect`, `imageCubeArray`, depth bounds, mesh shading,
  descriptor indexing). That is a decision made for the caller, against the
  one rule. It also hides mistakes: a caller that uses a feature without
  checking for it works on the machine it was written on, where the GPU
  happens to have it, and fails only on a user's GPU that lacks it. With
  only what was asked for switched on, a forgotten request fails on the
  developer's own machine.
- **No destroy, so no recovery.** Devices belong to the instance and live as
  long as it does. A lost device (a TDR, a driver reset, an eGPU unplugged)
  can only be replaced by destroying the whole instance.
- **Queues fixed by SpudGPU.** Vulkan makes one graphics queue; D3D12 four of
  each kind (`SPUD_D3D12_COMMAND_QUEUE_COUNT_PER_FAMILY`). The caller can't
  ask for a compute or copy queue on Vulkan at all
  (`spudgpu_get_command_queue` and `spudgpu_get_max_queue_count` are not
  written there).
- **Lazy state that had to be locked.** The device array is made by the first
  enumerate call, which is why `_devices_lock` exists on Vulkan and the
  D3D12 and Metal first calls still race. D3D12's bindless table is made by
  the first bindless call, which is why `_bindless_create_mutex` exists.
- **Capabilities asked of the wrong object.** `spudgpu_get_*_capabilities`
  and most of `SPUDGPU_DEVICE_PROPERTIES` describe the hardware, but are
  asked of a device; once a device exists the question that matters is what
  it was created with.

## What the callers use

Every call this replaces is used outside SpudLib, except
`spudgpu_get_command_queue` and `spudgpu_get_max_queue_count`, which
nothing calls. Every caller takes `devices[0]` or an index it was given,
and the graphics queue. Which callers use what, what each has to change and
in what order is in the workspace's `../SPUDGPU_DEVICE_MIGRATION.md`; this
file names none, as SpudLib names no caller.

## The proposal

The rules, then the header section.

- **Listing keeps nothing on an adapter.** The instance lists its adapters
  when it is created (`vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices`, `EnumAdapters1`,
  `MTLCopyAllDevices`) and never changes the list, so every adapter call may
  be made from any thread with no lock. The list is in the API's order,
  unsorted: preferring one GPU is the caller's. D3D12 is the one backend
  that has to create something to list: its features are only answered by a
  device (`CheckFeatureSupport`), so `spudgpu_create_instance` creates a
  probe device on each adapter in turn, reads it and releases it before the
  next (see "D3D12's probe device" below). The header says so, so that a
  discrete GPU waking at instance creation has its reason written down.
- **An adapter is listed only if a device can be created on it.** Vulkan:
  the physical device's `apiVersion` is 1.3 or later (unchecked today: a
  1.2 device is listed and fails at `vkCreateDevice`). D3D12: the probe
  device at feature level 12_0 is created. Metal: Metal 3. Software
  adapters (WARP, lavapipe, SwiftShader) are listed and marked; filtering
  them is the caller's. (D3D12 skips WARP today: a choice made for the
  caller, which goes.)
- **The list never changes, and nothing reports a GPU added or removed.**
  A GPU plugged in after the instance was made is not in its list; one
  unplugged leaves an adapter no device can be created on. A new instance
  lists the system as it is then. A polled call that says the list is out
  of date is a later item (see "Later, not in this change").
- **An adapter names its GPU.** `adapter_id` is equal for two adapters, in
  any instances of any processes, only if they are the same GPU; the
  reverse does not hold (a restart, a driver restart or a replug may give
  the GPU a new one), so the caller never stores one. The Windows LUID is a
  separate field, for interop that names an adapter by it. A choice saved
  across runs is matched by the hardware IDs and the description: the
  caller's.
- **Supported is the adapter's, enabled is the device's.** An adapter reports
  `supported_features`; a device has exactly its `required_features`, on
  every backend. Using a feature the device wasn't created with is refused
  with the result it gets today when the device lacks it (such as
  `SPUDRESULT_GPU_TIMESTAMPS_NOT_SUPPORTED`), or with
  `SPUDRESULT_GPU_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED` where there is none (a swap chain);
  a command a device can't record (a mesh dispatch, a depth bounds call)
  records nothing and asserts in a debug build. This is the header's usual
  answer to APIs that differ underneath: Vulkan needs features switched on,
  D3D12 and Metal don't, and the narrowest rule all three keep is "ask
  first".
- **Vulkan's base set is switched on for every device, and nothing else
  but what is asked for.** SpudGPU itself relies on `dynamicRendering`,
  `synchronization2` (barriers), `timelineSemaphore` (`spudgpu_fence`) and
  `bufferDeviceAddress` (every buffer has an address); Vulkan 1.3 requires
  all four, so the version check covers them. Everything else, the
  descriptor-indexing bits included (today switched on unconditionally,
  though only the bindless code uses update-after-bind and partially
  bound), is switched on only by the feature bit that needs it.
- **The caller asks for queues.** By kind and count, up to what the adapter
  reports. The device makes them all at creation and owns them;
  `spudgpu_get_command_queue` hands them out (and is written for Vulkan).
- **Queues come from pools, and the adapter lists them.** Vulkan makes each
  kind from one family, by the rule in `spudgpu_device_desc`, and kinds
  that fall back to one family share its `queueCount` (Intel Iris Xe: one
  family of one queue for all three kinds). Three separate maxima would
  hide that, so the adapter lists pools: the kinds each serves and the most
  queues it holds, and the desc's counts for a pool's kinds add up to at
  most that. D3D12 and Metal report three pools, one kind each, with no
  limit. Each pool says what the API reports about where its queues run:
  Vulkan knows the graphics family from a family without graphics; D3D12
  and Metal say nothing, which is reported as unknown rather than left to
  look like three separate families. No API promises that a queue kind has
  hardware of its own, or runs at the same time as graphics, and the header
  promises nothing either. (Settled 2026-10-21.)
- **SpudGPU sets no queue priority.** Vulkan gets the same value for every
  queue, which in its relative scheme is no preference; D3D12 gets
  `NORMAL`, its own no preference. The order work on different queues runs
  in is the driver's. Choosing a priority is a later feature bit (see
  "Later, not in this change"), since Metal has none.
- **One device per adapter at a time.** D3D12 returns the same device to a
  second `D3D12CreateDevice` on one adapter, and Metal has one `MTLDevice`
  per GPU; Vulkan would allow more, but the narrowest rule is one. A flag on
  the adapter, set atomically, is the only state this needs, and it is
  SpudGPU's to guard (the adapter is shared, hidden state).
- **One device per GPU in the process, across instances: the caller's
  rule.** Two instances list two adapters for one GPU, and on D3D12 a
  device made through each would be one `ID3D12Device` under two handles.
  SpudGPU can't see across instances without process-wide state, which it
  doesn't hold, so the caller keeps this, by `adapter_id`. It matters most
  in a recovery: the lost device is destroyed before a device on the same
  GPU is made in a new instance.
- **Nothing is made later, except what is keyed by a value the caller
  passes at a call or belongs to an object the caller synchronizes.**
  Settled 2026-10-21, against what engines do (Unreal's D3D12 RHI and
  NVRHI set up their descriptor heaps and bindless state at device
  creation):
  - The bindless table is made by `spudgpu_create_device` when
    `SPUDGPU_FEATURE_BINDLESS` is asked for, and not otherwise, on every
    backend. The pointer is set once and is null exactly when the feature
    wasn't asked for. `_devices_lock`, `_bindless_create_mutex` and D3D12's
    atomic `_bindless` go with the lazy state they guarded; the table keeps
    its own lock, since registering is done on any thread.
  - D3D12's shader-visible heaps (`_csv_heap`, `_sampler_heap`) are made by
    `spudgpu_create_device`, sized by the descriptor budget below, and not
    made at all for a budget of 0. A failure to make them fails the create
    call, not someone's first pool. `_shader_heap_mutex` stays, guarding the
    free lists only.
  - D3D12's indirect command signatures for tightly packed arguments
    (stride = the size of `spudgpu_draw_indirect_args`, and of
    `spudgpu_draw_indexed_indirect_args`) are made by
    `spudgpu_create_device`, so the common case takes no lock. A signature
    for any other stride is still made by the first draw that uses it,
    under `_indirect_signature_mutex`: it is keyed by the caller's stride,
    and making others ahead would be SpudGPU choosing strides. (Engines
    whose APIs fix the stride make every signature at init; a translator
    that takes a stride caches, as vkd3d-proton does the other way round.)
  - A command list's `_rtv_heap` and `_dsv_heap` stay lazy: the caller
    synchronizes the list, so this costs no lock and hides nothing shared.
    Engines write RTVs and DSVs once, at view creation, into a device-level
    CPU heap; that would need a shared allocator and its lock, and is not
    part of this change.
- **The caller sets the device's descriptor budget.** The shader-visible
  heaps' size was SpudGPU's choice (a million CBV/SRV/UAV descriptors and
  2048 samplers, made in full on first use), and Unreal and NVRHI both
  leave it to the application. A D3D12 heap size on the desc would be a
  field only one API acts on, so it is a rule all three keep instead: the
  desc's `max_descriptors` and `max_samplers` bound what the device's
  descriptor pools and bindless table hold at once, the adapter reports
  the most allowed, D3D12 sizes its heaps from the budget, and Vulkan and
  Metal count against it. A pool that doesn't fit is refused on every
  backend with `SPUDRESULT_GPU_OUT_OF_DESCRIPTORS`. Today only D3D12 refuses
  a pool when the samplers run out (with
  `SPUDRESULT_API_SPECIFIC_FAILURE`); this makes it one rule.
- **A debug build counts what is alive on a device.** Destroying a device
  with objects still made from it is the caller's mistake, and the
  graphics APIs report it unevenly (Vulkan's validation layer does; D3D12
  and Metal mostly don't). So a debug build keeps, per device, an atomic
  count of live objects for each kind of handle made from it (buffers,
  images, views, samplers, heaps, shader modules, pipelines, layouts,
  descriptor pools, command allocators and lists, fences, semaphores,
  swap chains, timestamp sets): each create call adds one when it
  succeeds, each destroy call takes one away. Atomic, because objects are
  made and destroyed on any thread. `spudgpu_destroy_device` prints every
  kind whose count isn't 0 (`spudgpu: device "name" destroyed with 3
  buffers, 1 pipeline alive`) and asserts. What has no destroy call of
  its own (descriptor sets, a swap chain's images and views) is counted
  through its owner, not separately; the queues are the device's own and
  not counted. A release build has no counter. This is the heaps' rule (a
  debug build counts live placements, and `spudgpu_destroy_heap` asserts
  the count is 0) applied to the device. The counters are in the backends'
  internal structs only; no public struct changes between builds.
- **A device can be destroyed and made again, and that is the recovery
  from a lost one.** Destroy everything made from the device, then the
  device; create a device on the same adapter. If that fails, for any
  reason, destroy the instance, make a new one, and find the GPU there by
  `adapter_id`, else by the hardware IDs, else choose again. No result
  tells "the adapter is gone" from another failure: D3D12 can't say so
  reliably at `D3D12CreateDevice`, and the caller does the same either
  way. This is WebGPU's rule (an adapter is spent; `requestAdapter` again)
  and DXGI's (`IsCurrent()`, a new factory, enumerate again). It covers a
  hang or reset (TDR), a driver update or restart, and an unplugged GPU.

### The header section

To replace `spudgpu.h` from `spudgpu_enumerate_devices` through
`spudgpu_get_command_queue`, keeping the vendor IDs and
`spudgpu_get_native_gpu_api`. It compiles as C11, C23 and C++20 against the
current `spudgpu.h` (2026-10-21).

### Build, GPU, device: EXT macros, feature bits and properties

Settled 2026-10-21. Three questions, each with its own answer in the
header, side by side:

| | Question | Known | If no |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SPUDGPU_EXT_*` macro | Does the backend in this build implement it? | at compile time | its functions and types don't exist: a compile error |
| bit in the adapter's `supported_features` | Does this GPU support it? | when the instance lists its adapters | the bit can't be asked for |
| bit in the device's features | Did the caller ask for it? | when the device is created | the call is refused |
| property | A fact about the GPU | when the instance lists its adapters | nothing is refused; the caller reads it |

**A feature or a property.** A capability that some call refuses without it
is a feature: a `SPUDGPU_FEATURE_*` bit the caller asks for when creating the
device. A fact that makes no call refuse is a property: a field of
`SPUDGPU_ADAPTER_PROPERTIES` the caller reads. So `DEVICE_MAPPABLE_MEMORY`
and `MAPPABLE_HEAPS` are bits although no API switches them on (a buffer or
heap of that kind is refused without them), and `unified_memory` is a
property (it only says which path is faster). A limit that only matters
with a feature is a property in that feature's chained limits struct, and
counts only on a device created with the feature. What SpudGPU itself
relies on (Vulkan's base set) is neither: it is required of an adapter.
Only the capabilities SpudGPU already tracks are bits, plus PRESENT; a new
one is sorted by this rule when it is added.

**Three cases for a capability:**

- *Only the backend varies*: an EXT macro, no bit. Bundles: Metal doesn't
  implement them, and every Vulkan and D3D12 GPU has them.
- *Only the GPU varies*: a bit, no EXT macro. Timestamps, layered
  rendering, PRESENT, depth bias clamp.
- *Both vary*: an EXT macro and a bit. Bindless: Metal doesn't implement
  it, and Vulkan and D3D12 GPUs differ (D3D12 needs binding tier 3).

**How they connect in the header:**

- The feature bits are always defined, never inside an `#if`: they are
  numbers. A bit whose EXT macro is 0 is never in any adapter's
  `supported_features`, so portable caller code asking for it compiles on
  every backend and asks for nothing there.
- An EXT group's functions and its limits struct stay inside its `#if`, as
  the capability structs are now. Their `SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE` values are in
  `spudcore.h` unconditionally, as every struct type is.
- An EXT's result keeps its number and widens: `SPUDRESULT_GPU_EXT_<NAME>_NOT_SUPPORTED`
  means the device wasn't created with the feature, which covers a GPU
  that lacks it, since that one can't be asked.
- Every EXT macro's comment says what it means and what it doesn't: "1
  when the backend compiled into this build implements <name>, 0
  otherwise. It says nothing about any GPU: whether one has it is
  SPUDGPU_FEATURE_<NAME> in its adapter's supported_features, and whether
  a device may use it is that bit in the device's features." (Every EXT
  macro, SpudGPU's and the other modules', gets its own version of the
  first sentence; the second only where a feature bit pairs with it.) The
  `EXT` prefix stays: it is the convention across SpudLib, and callers'
  own rules may name it.
- **Bindless is renamed so one name runs through it.** "Descriptor
  indexing" is Vulkan's word (D3D12 says binding tier 3, Metal argument
  buffers), and the bit and limits say "bindless":
  `SPUDGPU_EXT_BINDLESS_DESCRIPTOR_INDEXING` becomes `SPUDGPU_EXT_BINDLESS`,
  and `SPUDRESULT_GPU_EXT_BINDLESS_DESCRIPTOR_INDEXING_NOT_SUPPORTED`
  becomes `SPUDRESULT_GPU_EXT_BINDLESS_NOT_SUPPORTED`, same value (325).
  Mesh shading and the depth bounds test already share one name across
  macro, bit and result.
- `SPUDGPU_EXT_MESH_SHADING` and `SPUDGPU_EXT_DEPTH_BOUNDS_TEST` are 1 on
  every backend, so they gate nothing today; both are capabilities of the
  second case in practice. They stay, as markers for a backend that may
  lack them (an OpenGL one, see `CLAUDE.md`); dropping them would be its
  own cleanup.

**The four cases, as a caller writes them:**

1. Only the backend varies (bundles): a compile-time choice, nothing asked
   for.

   ```c
   #if SPUDGPU_EXT_BUNDLES
   	spudgpu_cmd_execute_bundle(cmd, static_scene_bundle);   /* recorded once */
   #else
   	record_static_scene(cmd);                               /* recorded every frame */
   #endif
   ```

2. Only the GPU varies (timestamps): no `#if`; asked for, then checked.

   ```c
   SPUDGPU_ADAPTER_PROPERTIES props = {.base.type = SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE_GPU_ADAPTER_PROPERTIES};
   spudgpu_get_adapter_properties(adapter, &props);

   spudgpu_device_desc desc = {.base.type = SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE_GPU_DEVICE_DESC};
   desc.required_features = props.supported_features & SPUDGPU_FEATURE_PASS_TIMESTAMPS;
   /* ... queues, budget ... */
   spudgpu_create_device(adapter, &desc, &device);

   if (spudgpu_get_device_features(device) & SPUDGPU_FEATURE_PASS_TIMESTAMPS)
   	spudgpu_create_timestamp_set(device, queue, 2 * pass_count, &timestamps);
   else
   	timestamps = NULL;   /* "not available" */
   ```

   Without the bit asked for, `spudgpu_create_timestamp_set` is refused even
   on a GPU that has timestamps: a forgotten request fails on the machine it
   was written on, not on a user's GPU that lacks the feature.

3. Both vary (bindless): asking compiles everywhere; using it is inside the
   `#if`.

   ```c
   /* On Metal, supported_features never has the bit: this asks for nothing. */
   desc.required_features = props.supported_features & SPUDGPU_FEATURE_BINDLESS;
   spudgpu_create_device(adapter, &desc, &device);

   bool bindless = false;
   #if SPUDGPU_EXT_BINDLESS
   bindless = (spudgpu_get_device_features(device) & SPUDGPU_FEATURE_BINDLESS) != 0;
   #endif

   if (bindless) {
   #if SPUDGPU_EXT_BINDLESS
   	uint32_t index;
   	spudgpu_bindless_register_sampled_image(device, albedo_view, &index);
   	material.albedo_index = index;
   #endif
   } else {
   	write_material_descriptor_set(device, &material, albedo_view);   /* every backend */
   }
   ```

   Its limits are `SPUDGPU_BINDLESS_LIMITS`, chained onto the adapter
   properties, inside the same `#if`.

4. A property (`unified_memory`): no `#if`, no bit, nothing asked for.

   ```c
   SPUDGPU_ADAPTER_PROPERTIES props = {.base.type = SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE_GPU_ADAPTER_PROPERTIES};
   spudgpu_get_adapter_properties(spudgpu_get_device_adapter(device), &props);

   if (props.unified_memory)
   	write_vertices_directly(upload_buffer, vertices);           /* one copy */
   else
   	stage_then_copy(cmd, staging, device_buffer, vertices);     /* CPU, staging, GPU */
   ```

New `SPUDRESULT`s, in the unused 211-219:
`SPUDRESULT_GPU_INVALID_ADAPTER` (211), `_FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED` (212),
`_TOO_MANY_QUEUES` (213), `_ADAPTER_IN_USE` (214), `_DEVICE_LOST` (215,
for the step below), `_OUT_OF_DESCRIPTORS` (216: a pool, or the bindless
table, past the device's budget, on every backend) and
`_DESCRIPTOR_BUDGET_TOO_LARGE` (217). New `SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE`s:
`_GPU_ADAPTER_PROPERTIES` (1026), `_GPU_DEVICE_DESC` (1027),
`_GPU_MESH_SHADING_LIMITS` (1028), `_GPU_BINDLESS_LIMITS` (1029). The
retired types (1000, 1017, 1020, 1021) are never reused.
`SPUDRESULT_GPU_DEVICE_ENUMERATION_FAILURE` becomes what
`spudgpu_create_instance` returns when the API can't list its GPUs; no
adapter is a count of 0, not a failure.

### What a caller looks like

```c
const spudgpu_adapter *adapters;
uint32_t adapter_count;
spudgpu_enumerate_adapters(instance, &adapters, &adapter_count);
if (adapter_count == 0) /* no GPU: the caller's to handle */;

SPUDGPU_MESH_SHADING_LIMITS mesh = {.base.type = SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE_GPU_MESH_SHADING_LIMITS};
SPUDGPU_ADAPTER_PROPERTIES props = {.base.type = SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE_GPU_ADAPTER_PROPERTIES,
                                    .base.next = &mesh.base};
spudgpu_get_adapter_properties(adapters[0], &props);

spudgpu_device_desc desc = {.base.type = SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE_GPU_DEVICE_DESC};
desc.required_features = props.supported_features &
    (SPUDGPU_FEATURE_MESH_SHADING | SPUDGPU_FEATURE_PASS_TIMESTAMPS);
desc.direct_queue_count = 1;

spudgpu_device device;
spudgpu_create_device(adapters[0], &desc, &device);
spudgpu_command_queue queue;
spudgpu_get_command_queue(device, SPUDGPU_COMMAND_LIST_TYPE_DIRECT, 0, &queue);
/* ... */
spudgpu_destroy_device(device);
spudgpu_destroy_instance(instance);
```

### Each backend

| | Adapter | `spudgpu_create_device` | Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vulkan | `VkPhysicalDevice`, properties and features read at instance creation | `vkCreateDevice`: the queue families the desc's counts need, the base set, and only the extensions and feature bits `required_features` names (`VK_KHR_swapchain` for PRESENT, the descriptor-indexing bits for BINDLESS); then the queues, and the bindless table if asked | each bit maps to the `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures*` member or extension it needs today |
| D3D12 | `IDXGIAdapter4`, with `DXGI_ADAPTER_DESC3` and the `CheckFeatureSupport` answers read through a probe device, released before the next adapter's | `D3D12CreateDevice` at 12_0, the queues, the debug callback, the shader-visible heaps sized by the budget, the tightly packed indirect signatures, and the bindless range if asked | nothing to switch on; the device checks its bits |
| Metal | `id<MTLDevice>` from `MTLCopyAllDevices` | the queues, and the bindless argument-buffer state if asked | nothing to switch on; the device checks its bits |

#### D3D12's probe device

Settled 2026-10-21. `DXGI_ADAPTER_DESC3` gives the name, IDs, memory sizes,
LUID and the software flag with no device, but every answer that becomes
`supported_features` (`OPTIONS`, `OPTIONS2`, `OPTIONS7`, the resource
binding tier, `ARCHITECTURE1`) is a `CheckFeatureSupport` call, a device
method; no device-free source has them. Probing on the first properties
call instead would bring back lazy state and a lock and save nothing, since
a caller choosing a GPU asks about all of them; keeping the probe for
`spudgpu_create_device` would hold a device on every adapter, the first
complaint above. So:

1. `spudgpu_create_instance`, per adapter in `EnumAdapters1` order:
   `GetDesc3`; `D3D12CreateDevice` at 12_0 into a local `ComPtr` (failure:
   the adapter isn't listed); the `CheckFeatureSupport` calls; release.
   One probe at a time, never all at once. The separate
   `D3D12CreateDevice(..., nullptr)` test goes: the probe answers it.
2. The probe is fully released before `spudgpu_create_device` can run.
   D3D12 hands back the one live device per adapter, so a probe still held
   would become the caller's device, with what it carried.
3. The debug callback is registered by `spudgpu_create_device` only, never
   on the probe.
4. The debug layer is switched on before the first probe, in
   `spudgpu_create_instance`, where it is now (until the later item on
   validation moves the choice to the caller).
5. Software adapters (WARP) are listed, as SPUDGPU_ADAPTER_TYPE_SOFTWARE.
6. The header says what listing costs on D3D12 (in
   spudgpu_enumerate_adapters()'s comment above).

A device made twice on the adapter the caller uses is the price, once per
run or per recovery. Measure instance creation on the Iris Xe and the RTX
A2000 when the D3D12 work is done.

### Device loss, a step after

`SPUDRESULT_GPU_DEVICE_LOST` is only useful if every call that can see it
returns it. Today `spudgpu_swap_chain_present` and `spudgpu_queue_wait_idle`
return nothing and `spudgpu_swap_chain_acquire_next_image` returns an index.
After this change: those return a `SPUDRESULT` (acquire gives its index
through an output), and submit, present, acquire, wait-idle and
`spudgpu_wait_for_fences` return `SPUDRESULT_GPU_DEVICE_LOST` when the API
says so (`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`, `DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED` /
`_RESET`, `MTLCommandBufferErrorDeviceRemoved`). A separate change, since it
touches the frame loop of every caller.

## Open questions

- **`spudgpu_get_graphics_queue`.** Decided: removed. It was
  `(DIRECT, 0)`; the callers ask `spudgpu_get_command_queue` for that.
- **A migration shim.** A `spudgpu_enumerate_devices` kept for a while, that
  creates a device on adapter 0 with every supported feature, would let the
  callers move one at a time. Proposed: no shim; change the callers in the
  same change, as the version policy allows before 1.0.0.

## A lost device (added 2026-10-30, for a caller's frame wait)

`SPUDRESULT_GPU_DEVICE_LOST` (253): the device is lost, and nothing more
it runs completes. Returned by `spudgpu_wait_for_fences` and the three
submissions on Vulkan (`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`) and D3D12
(`GetDeviceRemovedReason` asked before and after a fence wait, and around a
submission; a removed device signals every fence to UINT64_MAX, so a wait
would otherwise end as if it had succeeded). Never on Metal: Apple Silicon
has no lost device (`MTLCommandBufferErrorDeviceRemoved` can't occur there,
deprecated in the macOS 27 SDK), and a command buffer that faults fails
alone. Written on macOS 2026-10-30 and not compiled: there are no Vulkan or
D3D12 headers on that machine. Left: compile and run it on Windows (D3D12,
Vulkan) and Linux (Vulkan); nothing forces a device to be lost, so the
runs check the build and that nothing else changed. The present and the
acquire (`void`, and a `UINT32_MAX` index) still can't say they failed for
this reason: a change of their signatures, not made.

## Later, not in this change

- **A polled "the adapters changed" call.** Recovery by a new instance is
  the common practice (WebGPU, DXGI's guidance, Chromium) and most engines
  stop there. Notification is for a caller that wants a GPU attached while
  it runs, or must let go of one being ejected. The shape, so it is decided:

  ```c
  /* Whether the system's GPUs differ from those this instance listed when
   * it was created. True changes nothing in the instance: the caller makes
   * a new one when it chooses, and finds what changed by adapter_id. */
  SPUDRESULT spudgpu_instance_adapters_changed(spudgpu_instance instance,
                                               bool *out_changed);
  ```

  D3D12: `IDXGIFactory1::IsCurrent()`. Metal: an atomic flag the
  `MTLCopyAllDevicesWithObserver` block sets (Metal runs it on its own
  queue; SpudGPU starts no thread). Vulkan has nothing; the OS does: a
  udev monitor on Linux, `CM_Register_Notification` with
  `GUID_DEVINTERFACE_DISPLAY_ADAPTER` on Windows, read at each call, as
  SpudInput reads inotify at each poll. A waitable form (an fd or event for
  a wait set) only if a caller needs it. Build it when a caller asks.
- **Queue priority, an optional feature bit.** Vulkan (a relative float
  per queue, at least two distinct levels) and D3D12 (`NORMAL`, `HIGH`)
  have a priority within the device, both hints; Metal has none. So it is
  a capability, not a rule: `SPUDGPU_FEATURE_QUEUE_PRIORITY`, supported on
  Vulkan and D3D12 and never on Metal, and with it a struct chained onto
  `spudgpu_device_desc` giving each queue `NORMAL` or `HIGH` (two levels,
  what every API with priorities guarantees). The chained struct without
  the bit is refused. A bit and not an `SPUDGPU_EXT_*` macro: it is a desc
  field, and a public struct holds no `#if`. Priority against other
  processes (`VK_KHR_global_priority`, D3D12's `GLOBAL_REALTIME`), which
  may need privileges, is a second bit with its own refusal for them. Build
  when a caller asks; one whose uploads on a copy queue shouldn't slow its
  frame is the likely first.
- **Validation is the caller's choice.** Both backends switch it on by
  themselves in a debug build: the D3D12 debug layer
  (`spudgpud3d12context.cpp`, `EnableDebugLayer` in
  `spudgpu_create_instance`) and `VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation`
  (`spudgpuvulkancontext.c`). That is a decision made for the caller, and on
  D3D12 a process-wide one: switching the layer on removes every D3D12
  device the process already has. It becomes a field of
  `spudgpu_instance_desc` (off, on, on with GPU-based validation), with no
  default, in every build. Its own change. **Decided 2026-10-28 with the
  user (card S3): build it now**, before 1.0, with every caller in the
  workspace in the same change. It needs Windows runs for D3D12 and Vulkan
  (and a Linux one for Vulkan); Metal's half maps to its API validation
  and shader validation where the process allows.
- **SpudGPU's own checks and where messages go. Decided 2026-10-28 with
  the user (card S2):** an opt-in check layer, built with S3 in the same
  change. Unreal's RHI validation (`-rhivalidation`) is the model: checks
  of SpudGPU's own rules on top of the native layers, which can't see them.
  - **One callback for every message.** `spudgpu_instance_desc` takes a
    message callback and its context. A message carries a severity, a
    source (SpudGPU's own check, the native layer, GPU-based validation),
    an id, the text and the object's debug name. D3D12's info queue,
    Vulkan's debug messenger (none is registered today, so its layer
    prints on its own) and Metal's reports all go to it, and the `printf`
    in `spudgpu_d3d12_debug_message` goes. Logging, breaking or asserting
    is the caller's choice.
  - **Levels are S3's field:** off, on (the native layer plus SpudGPU's
    own checks), on with GPU-based validation. Validation on with no
    callback is refused at creation, so no message is dropped unseen.
  - **In every build, switched at runtime:** off costs one predictable
    branch per call; Debug and Release don't differ, so a Release-only bug
    can be validated. The `void` calls stay `void` (option (c), results on
    every call, was turned down: it taxes every draw).
  - **What SpudGPU checks:** destroyed or foreign handles (another
    device's), recording outside begin and end, bindings past the
    descriptor budget, an EXT used without its feature bit, overlapping
    calls on one object (X3's Debug check, here for SpudGPU), and barrier
    states where cheap to track.
  - **A misuse test harness:** each misuse made on purpose, the test
    asserting the callback got the expected message id, on all three
    backends (`ROADMAP.md`'s misuse harness, extended to the `void`
    calls).

- **Dynamic uniform offsets. Decided 2026-10-28 with the user (card A3):**
  binding a uniform buffer from a byte offset given per draw, so a caller
  can write per-draw data into one buffer and point each draw at its part:
  Vulkan's dynamic offsets, a root CBV's GPU address on D3D12, a buffer
  offset on Metal. A translation, its own change, with a sample or test on
  all three backends. Within the rules because it only translates:
  SpudGPU keeps no ring buffer and hands out no offsets (that is the
  caller's memory policy); it reports the offset alignment the device
  requires and the most dynamic bindings a layout may have (D3D12's root
  signature is small), and refuses a misaligned offset or one too many,
  reported through S2's callback, never rounding.
- **MSAA and resolve. Decided 2026-10-28 with the user (card A4):** a
  translation of what all three APIs have. Not started.

  ```c
  /* Which sample counts a format supports: sample_count_mask in
   * spudgpu_format_properties (card A13, below), bit 0 = 1 sample,
   * bit 1 = 2, bit 2 = 4, bit 3 = 8. Translates
   * vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties, D3D12's
   * CheckFeatureSupport(MULTISAMPLE_QUALITY_LEVELS) and Metal's
   * supportsTextureSampleCount:. Never picks one. */

  typedef struct spudgpu_image_desc {
      /* ...existing fields... */
      uint32_t sample_count;          /* 1, 2, 4 or 8; one the query reported */
  } spudgpu_image_desc;

  /* New usage bit: the image lives only within a render pass and is never
   * stored (Metal memoryless, Vulkan TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT with lazily
   * allocated memory, D3D12: an ordinary texture). */
  SPUDGPU_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT

  typedef struct spudgpu_color_attachment_desc {
      /* ...existing view, load_op, store_op, clear... */
      spudgpu_image_view   resolve_view;   /* NULL: no resolve */
      SPUDGPU_RESOLVE_MODE resolve_mode;   /* AVERAGE for color */
  } spudgpu_color_attachment_desc;

  typedef struct spudgpu_graphics_pipeline_desc {
      /* ...existing... */
      uint32_t sample_count;          /* must match the pass's targets */
      bool     alpha_to_coverage;     /* soft edges for foliage, cutouts */
  } spudgpu_graphics_pipeline_desc;
  ```

  The depth attachment takes a resolve view and a mode too (SAMPLE_ZERO,
  MIN, MAX: Vulkan's depth resolve, D3D12's `ResolveSubresourceRegion`
  modes, Metal's depth resolve filter), each reported per device. Names
  are illustrative; the field placement follows the headers when built.
  A sample per backend, its readback checked.
- **Stencil test state. Decided 2026-10-28 with the user (card A5):**
  `spudgpu_graphics_pipeline_desc` takes a stencil state - enable, compare
  function, pass, fail and depth-fail operations for front and back faces,
  read and write masks - and `spudgpu_cmd_set_stencil_reference()` sets
  the reference per draw (`vkCmdSetStencilReference`,
  `OMSetStencilRef`, `setStencilReferenceValue:`). Depth-stencil formats
  supported are reported per device, never chosen (no D24_S8 on Apple
  GPUs; D32_FLOAT_S8 is). A translation; not started. A sample per
  backend, its readback checked.
- **Read-only depth layouts. Decided 2026-10-28 with the user (card
  A11):** `SPUDGPU_IMAGE_LAYOUT` gains read-only depth and depth-stencil
  layouts (and the mixed ones: depth read-only with stencil written, and
  the reverse), so a pass can test against a depth image and sample it:
  Vulkan's `DEPTH_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL` and its stencil variants, D3D12's
  `DEPTH_READ` combined with shader-resource, and on Metal, which has no
  layouts, what Metal's own rules require. A translation; not started.
- **What a format supports. Decided 2026-10-28 with the user (card
  A13):** one query per device and format, taking in A4's sample counts.
  Not started.

  ```c
  typedef struct spudgpu_format_properties {
      bool     sampled, filterable, color_target, blendable,
               depth_stencil_target, storage_read, storage_write;
      uint32_t sample_count_mask;   /* card A4's bit mask */
  } spudgpu_format_properties;

  SPUDRESULT spudgpu_get_format_properties(spudgpu_device device,
                                           SPUDGPU_FORMAT format,
                                           spudgpu_format_properties *out);
  ```

  Vulkan's `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties` and image format
  properties, D3D12's `CheckFeatureSupport(FORMAT_SUPPORT)` and
  multisample levels, and on Metal the GPU family's format table (Metal
  has no query, so the backend carries Apple's published table per
  family). A struct base when written, as SpudGPU's other structs.
- **Indirect dispatch. Decided 2026-10-28 with the user (card A15):**
  compute dispatch (and mesh-shader dispatch where the device has mesh
  shading) with the group counts read from a buffer:
  `vkCmdDispatchIndirect` / `vkCmdDrawMeshTasksIndirectEXT`, D3D12's
  `ExecuteIndirect` with a dispatch signature, Metal's
  `dispatchThreadgroupsWithIndirectBuffer:`. A translation; not started.
- **Bindless on Metal. Decided 2026-10-28 with the user (card A15):**
  `SPUDGPU_EXT_BINDLESS` on the Metal backend through argument buffers
  tier 2 (Apple Silicon), reported per device as the other backends'; then
  it is no longer compiled out on Metal. Not started.
- **Each API's own shader format; no compiler in SpudLib. Decided
  2026-10-28 with the user** (challenging card A9's "SPIR-V only").
  Today the D3D12 backend converts SPIR-V with SPIRV-Cross to HLSL and
  compiles it with DXC at run time, and the Metal backend converts it to
  Metal source and has Metal compile it: two compiles per pipeline at run
  time, DXC and SPIRV-Cross shipped in every application, options chosen
  inside SpudLib (a shader model, a register mapping) that are hidden
  policy (card S2's wording), native features SPIR-V can't express out of
  reach, and generated code in the platform's shader debugger.
  - `spudgpu_shader_module_desc` names its format: SPIR-V (Vulkan), DXIL
    (D3D12), a `.metallib` or Metal source (Metal). A device reports the
    formats it takes and refuses another. SpudGPU compiles nothing:
    SPIRV-Cross and DXC leave its backends.
  - Cross-compilation is the caller's, at build time or with a runtime
    module of its own. As Unreal and bgfx ship native binaries.
  - Reflection the backends do today (D3D12's register mapping from
    SPIR-V) comes from the caller with the module, or from the native
    format's own reflection.
  - Every caller changes in the same change, before 1.0. Not started; the
    source language is card A29.
- **Specialization constants. Decided 2026-10-28 with the user (card
  A9):** a pipeline desc takes (constant id, value) pairs for its shader
  modules: Vulkan's `VkSpecializationInfo`; Metal's function constants;
  D3D12 has none, so with native formats a variant is a DXIL the caller
  compiled for it (as Unreal's permutations are), and the EXT is reported
  unsupported there. To be settled with the native formats. A
  translation; not started.
- **Pipeline caches, later (card A9):** `VkPipelineCache`, D3D12's
  `ID3D12PipelineLibrary`, Metal's `MTLBinaryArchive`, as bytes the caller
  is handed to keep and gives back; SpudGPU writes no file.
- **Hardware ray tracing. Decided 2026-10-28 with the user (card S12).**
  Not started.
  0. **First, a test:** that the shader path carries ray queries - GLSL
     `GL_EXT_ray_query` to SPIR-V, and SPIRV-Cross to HLSL (`RayQuery`,
     DXR 1.1) and to Metal (`intersector`), each run. If a target fails, the
     shader route for these shaders is decided before anything else.
  1. **`SPUDGPU_EXT_RAY_QUERY`**, paired with a device feature bit (card
     S3's), the narrow island `CLAUDE.md` expects: acceleration structures
     (bottom level per mesh, top level of instances) created, built,
     refitted and compacted; one as a shader binding; ray queries in
     compute and fragment shaders. Vulkan `VK_KHR_acceleration_structure`
     and `VK_KHR_ray_query`; D3D12 DXR 1.1; Metal acceleration structures
     and intersectors (hardware from Apple's M3). The caller's fallback on
     a GPU without it (an Iris Xe).
  - **Ray tracing pipelines are not part of it** (asked 2026-10-28). Vulkan's
    and D3D12's map nearly one to one (the same stages - ray generation,
    miss, closest-hit, any-hit, intersection, callable - shader tables of
    32-byte handles, recursion to a limit; they differ in per-record
    resources, D3D12's local root signatures against Vulkan's record data,
    in table alignment, and in adding shaders to a pipeline). Metal has no
    such pipeline: a compute kernel intersects and decides, with
    intersection and visible function tables for the swappable parts and
    no recursion, so carrying Vulkan's model onto Metal would be SpudLib
    inventing one. **The planned shape, if inline queries prove not
    enough** (measured on an Apple M5 Pro; alpha-tested geometry and a path
    tracer, card T16, are the likely cases), is **two sibling EXTs, each a
    straight translation:**
    - `SPUDGPU_EXT_RAY_TRACING_PIPELINE`, Vulkan and D3D12 only, compiled
      out on Metal as `SPUDGPU_EXT_BUNDLES` is on the other side;
    - an Apple EXT (`SPUDGPU_EXT_METAL_RAY_FUNCTIONS`, name to settle),
      Metal only, translating Metal's own model: intersection function
      tables and Metal 4's intersection function buffers (alpha-tested and
      custom geometry), visible function tables (a material's function by
      index), linked into compute pipelines. Its shaders can't be SPIR-V
      (the attributes have no SPIR-V form); with native shader formats
      (below, 2026-10-28) a `.metallib` is an ordinary input on Metal, so
      this is no exception.
    A caller writes its pipeline work once per EXT and hides the
    difference from its own callers.
    **Metal 4, checked 2026-10-28:** it has *intersection function buffers*
    (`MTLIntersectionFunctionBufferArguments`: a buffer of
    intersection-function handles with a stride, 8-byte aligned, and a
    user-data pointer; functions declared for them), with an intersection
    function table offset per geometry and instance summed into the index,
    as a shader table's hit records are. Apple presents them, with Metal
    Shader Converter, as the way to map an existing shader binding table
    onto Metal (WWDC25 "Level up your games" and "Go further with Metal 4
    games"; the sample "Ray tracing with Intersection Function Buffer"
    emulates a DXR shader table). But they cover the **intersection side**
    (any-hit, intersection); closest-hit, miss and callable still go
    through visible function tables called from the kernel, and there is
    still no recursion - MoltenVK's work in progress (PR 2771, not merged
    when checked) splits it exactly so. So Metal 4 sits closer to the
    other two than older Metal, not close enough for one pipeline EXT on
    all three; the two-EXT shape stands, its Apple half built on Metal 4's
    buffers where available.
- **A room check before SpudLib's 1.0** (card A15, in the workspace's
  `DECISIONS.md`): every deferred SpudGPU item with the
  way it would be added after 1.0, and the ones whose shape needs a field
  taken before the freeze. Card S11 started it for video.

## Breaks

Every caller: listing devices and taking the graphics queue both change,
and so does reading properties and capabilities, and the Vulkan and D3D12
natives that take a device. Every caller that presents asks for
SPUDGPU_FEATURE_PRESENT, and every caller sets a descriptor budget. A
shader outside bindless that uses `nonuniformEXT` is outside Vulkan's rules
once the descriptor-indexing bits are off. The callers change in the same
change and run their tests (`../SPUDGPU_DEVICE_MIGRATION.md`). All three
backends change: build `macos-metal`, `linux-vulkan` and `windows-d3d12`.

## Done when

The steps every item of `MATURITY_TODO.md` ends with:

- build on macOS and run the tests, plain and under the `-asan` and `-tsan`
  presets;
- build every caller the change breaks, in the same change, and run its
  tests, on all three backends (`../SPUDGPU_DEVICE_MIGRATION.md` lists
  them);
- `./check.sh` from the workspace;
- after the spudlib commit is pushed, `./check.sh --update-locks`, and commit
  the locks with the repositories that use them;
- each changed repository's `.git/COMMIT_DRAFT` rewritten to describe its
  change;
- `CLAUDE.md`: the threading entry under "Known gaps" shortened (the device
  array and the lazy bindless table are gone); the "lazily created member"
  exception names `_rtv_heap`, `_dsv_heap` and the indirect signatures of
  other strides only; the known gap on D3D12's shader-visible heaps says
  they are made with the device, sized by the caller's budget, and that a
  pool past it is refused on every backend;
- `CLAUDE.md`, SpudGPU conventions: the `SPUDGPU_EXT_*` paragraph says an
  EXT pairs with a `SPUDGPU_FEATURE_*` bit where support varies by GPU,
  and its result is returned when the device wasn't created with the bit;
  the mesh shading paragraph and the `SPUDGPU_LEGACY_*` paragraph point to
  the feature bits instead of `spudgpu_get_mesh_shading_capabilities` and
  `spudgpu_bindless_capabilities::supported`; the bindless names follow the
  rename.
