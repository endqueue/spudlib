/*
 * What SpudNet's source files share with one another. Not a public header.
 *
 * Four things live here:
 *
 * - What a spudnet_instance is, which is the same everywhere: nothing but
 *   the fact that it was made, and the caller's allocator. Each platform
 *   makes and destroys it where it starts and stops its networking.
 * - Small helpers that are the same on every platform: a spudnet_error
 *   record's handling, the checks on a spudnet_tls_desc and a
 *   spudnet_proxy_desc that don't depend on the stack, the walk through a
 *   certificate that finds its public key. Defined in src/spudnet.c.
 * - The HTTP transfer. Its order of use, its argument checks, its
 *   accounting of a sized body and the storage of a response's status and
 *   headers are the same whichever stack carries it, so they are written
 *   once, in src/net/spudnethttp.c, which defines every
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_* in spudnet.h. What differs - getting the bytes
 *   to and from the network - is the stack's, behind the
 *   spudnet_http_backend_* functions each HTTP backend defines.
 * - What a wait set needs from the objects in it.
