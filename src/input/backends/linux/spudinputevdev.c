/*
 * SpudInput on the kernel's event devices: Linux.
 *
 * Each gamepad is one /dev/input/event* node, opened by this file and read
 * without waiting. A device is a gamepad when the kernel gives it
 * BTN_GAMEPAD (BTN_SOUTH), and the kernel's gamepad codes
 * (Documentation/input/gamepad.rst) are the whole of the mapping: there is
 * no table of devices in this file.
 *
 * Which nodes there are is learnt from inotify on /dev/input, read at each
 * poll: a new node, or one whose permissions change (udev gives the user
 * access after it creates the node), makes the poll look through the
 * directory again. A device that has gone is seen when reading it fails
 * with ENODEV. Nothing waits and no thread is started.
 *
 * Every change the kernel reports is taken, not only how things stand at
 * the poll, so a press shorter than the time between two polls is still in
 * buttons_went_down and buttons_went_up. When the kernel's buffer
 * overflowed (SYN_DROPPED), the device's state is read again whole.
 *
 * The kernel's codes, as this file reads them:
 * - Sticks: ABS_X and ABS_Y, ABS_RX and ABS_RY. Its y grows towards the
 *   user; spudinput.h's grows away.
 * - Triggers: ABS_HAT2Y (left) and ABS_HAT2X (right), as gamepad.rst has
 *   them, else ABS_Z and ABS_RZ, which is where the common drivers (xpad,
 *   hid-playstation) put them; else BTN_TL2 and BTN_TR2, read as 0 or 1.
 * - D-pad: BTN_DPAD_*, and ABS_HAT0X and ABS_HAT0Y, whichever the device
 *   has.
 * - Face buttons by their kernel names, BTN_SOUTH, BTN_EAST, BTN_NORTH and
 *   BTN_WEST, as the driver reports them.
 *
 * Rumble is FF_RUMBLE: one effect per gamepad, uploaded with the two motor
 * levels and played. Each play lasts SPUDINPUT_EVDEV_RUMBLE_LENGTH_MS, and
 * a poll plays it again once SPUDINPUT_RUMBLE_POLL_INTERVAL_MAX_MS has gone
 * by, so that a motor runs for as long as the polls keep coming and stops
 * soon after they don't.
 *
 * The battery and the lights are not in the event node: the driver gives
 * them in sysfs, under the device the node belongs to (the node's input
 * device, or the HID device or USB interface above it), and this file
 * looks in both when it first opens a gamepad. What it finds there then is
 * what the gamepad has: a battery or a light the driver registers later is
 * not seen.
 *
 * - Battery: the first power_supply there of type Battery. Its files are
 *   kept open and read again at each poll: status, and capacity (a
 *   percentage) or else capacity_level (five steps from Critical to Full).
 * - Light colour: a multicolor LED with red, green and blue channels (its
 *   multi_intensity, then its brightness at the most), else three LEDs whose
 *   names give the colours red, green and blue.
 * - Player indicator: the LEDs whose names end in player-1, player-2 and so
 *   on, by the kernel's LED naming (devicename:color:function). Player n
 *   lights the LED named player-n alone; the greatest n is the last of an
 *   unbroken run from player-1.
 *
 * LED files are root's to write unless a udev rule says otherwise, so
 * setting a light usually fails with SPUDRESULT_SPUDINPUT_ACCESS_DENIED.
 *
 * Not written: motion sensors and touch surfaces, which the kernel gives as
 * sibling event nodes of the same device; no gamepad here has them. The
 * kernel has no labels.
