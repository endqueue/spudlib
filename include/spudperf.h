/**
 * @file spudperf.h
 * @brief SpudPerf: the platform's clocks, its wait on one of them, and the
 * process's memory counters.
 *
 * Each call reads one value from the operating system or the CPU and returns
 * it, or, for spudperf_sleep_until_monotonic_ns() and
 * spudperf_sleep_until_monotonic_ms(), hands the calling thread to the
 * operating system until a time. Nothing is measured, averaged or
 * kept between calls, and no call takes a handle: there is no state to own.
 *
 * @par Threads
 * No call takes an object, so under the library rule (spudcore.h, "Threads")
 * any call may overlap any other.
 *
 * No function here returns a SPUDRESULT. The clocks cannot fail, and
 * spudperf_get_ram_usage() reports a failed read as 0.

 * point in time, not a length of time, so a caller that wakes late and waits
 * for its next point does not fall further behind.

 * | Platform | The wait |
 * |---|---|
 * | Windows | A waitable timer (`CREATE_WAITABLE_TIMER_HIGH_RESOLUTION` where the system has it), set for what is left on `QueryPerformanceCounter` |
 * | Apple | `mach_wait_until` |
 * | Linux | `clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TIMER_ABSTIME)` |

 * It never returns before the clock has reached @p deadline_ns: a wait the
 * system ends early (a signal, a spurious wake) is taken up again. It
 * returns at once if the clock is already there. How long after the
 * deadline it returns is the operating system's scheduler's to say, and no
 * bound is promised. On macOS it has been measured at a quarter of a
 * millisecond for a wait of one millisecond and at five milliseconds for
 * waits of twenty and more, which the system's timer coalescing allows
 * itself; on Windows expect the system's timer resolution where the
 * high-resolution timer is missing.
 *
 * On Apple platforms the clock stops while the system sleeps, so a wait
 * that spans a sleep is that much longer in time of day.
