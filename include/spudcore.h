 * @defgroup spud_version Version
 * @brief Which spudlib a caller was built against, and which it runs on.
 *
 * One version for the whole library: spudlib is built and linked as one
 * archive, so its modules can't be mixed from different versions.
 *
 * What a version promises, from 1.0.0 on:
 *
 * | Change in | May add | May change or remove |
 * |-----------|---------|----------------------|
 * | patch     | nothing | nothing: fixes only, no header change but comments |
 * | minor     | functions, SPUDRESULT values, SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE values, chained structs, enumerators | nothing |
 * | major     | anything | anything |
 *
 * "Released" means a commit tagged vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Before 1.0.0, a
 * minor may change anything; nothing is promised.
 *
 * A struct that can be chained says in its comment which version first
 * takes it ("Since 1.2.0"), so that a caller can ask spud_get_version()
 * before chaining it. A caller that doesn't ask loses nothing but the
 * question: a spudlib that doesn't take a struct refuses the chain with
 * SPUDRESULT_STRUCT_UNKNOWN_IN_CHAIN.

/**
 * @defgroup spud_threads Threads
 * @brief Every SpudLib object is used by one caller at a time.
 *
 * The rule for every module, stated here once:
 *
 * - Every object (an instance, a device, a queue, a stream, a socket, a
 *   file, any handle a `_create` gives) is used by one caller at a time.
 *   A use is any call that takes the object, or an object it hands out
 *   that is not an object of its own, from the moment the call is made
 *   until it returns. Vulkan calls this "externally synchronized".
 * - The rule is serialization, not thread identity. No object belongs to
 *   a thread: it may be called from any thread, and from a different one
 *   each time (a Swift actor, a C# continuation), so long as no two calls
 *   on it overlap. Ordering the calls is the caller's, by whatever means
 *   it has; SpudLib takes no lock for it.
 * - Different objects are independent: calls on two objects may overlap,
 *   wherever each was made from. What SpudLib keeps for itself behind the
 *   handles (a shared table, an adapter's one device) it guards itself.
 * - A call that takes no object (SpudPerf's and SpudMemory's calls, and
 *   SpudFiles' path calls) has nothing to order and may overlap any call.
 * - The exceptions are few and each is marked on the call itself, by a
 *   line that begins `Thread:` - a call that may overlap others on the
 *   same object (an abort, a status read), a function of the caller's
 *   that SpudLib or the platform calls on a thread of its own, and a call
 *   the platform confines to one thread. A module's `@par Threads`
 *   paragraph says only what is particular to that module.
 *
 * Checking it: a Debug build asserts when two calls overlap on one
 * SpudGPU queue (spudgpu_submit_command_lists()). Not yet for any other
 * object.

 *
 * An extensible struct's first member is a SPUD_STRUCT_BASE (one the
 * caller fills in) or a SPUD_STRUCT_BASE_OUT (one SpudLib fills in), named
 * `base`. `base.type` says which struct it is; `base.next` points to the
 * next struct in its chain, or is NULL. A struct's layout never changes
 * once it is released: a new field comes as a new struct with a base of
 * its own, which the caller chains on. A struct with no base is frozen and
 * never changes at all; a new need gets a new type.
 *
 * - The caller sets every `base.type` in a chain, the root's included.
 *   A type that isn't the one the call takes is refused with
 *   SPUDRESULT_STRUCT_WRONG_TYPE.
 * - A chained struct the call doesn't take there, or this build doesn't
 *   know, is refused with SPUDRESULT_STRUCT_UNKNOWN_IN_CHAIN, never
 *   skipped: skipping it would decide for the caller that it didn't
 *   matter. One type twice in a chain is refused with
 *   SPUDRESULT_STRUCT_DUPLICATE_IN_CHAIN.
 * - Leaving a chained struct out means that addition isn't used. Each
 *   chained struct's fields have no defaults, as no desc's do.
 *
 * ```c
 * spudgpu_image_desc desc = {
 * 	.base = { SPUD_STRUCT_TYPE_GPU_IMAGE_DESC, NULL },
 * 	...
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * The member is nested, not two loose fields, so that a pointer to any based
 * struct converts to a pointer to its base and back (C11 6.7.2.1p15): a
 * chain is walked through SPUD_STRUCT_BASE pointers with defined behaviour.

/**
 * @defgroup spud_allocator The caller's allocator
 * @brief Where SpudLib's own memory comes from.
 *
 * SpudLib never chooses where its memory comes from. Each module's
 * instance is made with a SPUD_ALLOCATOR, and SpudLib takes every block
 * it needs for that instance, and for every object made from it, from that
 * allocator alone: the handles, the copies it keeps (debug names, descs),
 * and its own lists and tables. An object never has an allocator of its
 * own, and a destroy call never takes one: an object frees through the
 * allocator of the instance it was made from.
 *
 * Memory that the platform, the operating system or a graphics driver
 * allocates for itself is not covered, because those offer SpudLib no way
 * to pass an allocator on.
 *
 * There is no default. A create call given no allocator refuses it with
 * SPUDRESULT_NULL_ALLOCATOR, and one missing either function with
 * SPUDRESULT_INVALID_ALLOCATOR. spud_allocator_system() is the system heap,
 * for a caller that chooses it.
 *
 * The rules an allocator keeps:
 *
 * - `allocate` returns a block of at least `size` bytes whose address is a
 *   multiple of `alignment`, or NULL if it can't. SpudLib then fails the
 *   call it was making with SPUDRESULT_OUT_OF_MEMORY and leaves everything
 *   as it was before the call. The block's contents are undefined.
 * - SpudLib never asks for 0 bytes. `alignment` is always a power of two,
 *   1 or more. An allocator that can't meet an alignment returns NULL.
 * - `free` is called once for each block, with the same `size` and
 *   `alignment` the block was allocated with, so an allocator need not
 *   record either. It is never called with NULL, and it can't fail.
 * - Thread: either function may be called on any thread, and by calls
 *   that overlap: different objects of one instance are independent
 *   (@ref spud_threads "Threads"), so their calls may allocate at once,
 *   and a few calls allocate on a thread that is not the caller's, each
 *   marked so in its module's header (SpudAudio's device-event watch,
 *   SpudInput's GameInput device callback). An allocator that can't take
 *   overlapping calls is the caller's to keep to itself, by using that
 *   instance and everything made from it one call at a time and leaving
 *   those calls out.
 * - Neither function may call SpudLib.
 * - SpudLib copies the SPUD_ALLOCATOR when the instance is made, so the
 *   caller's struct need not outlive the call. The functions and
 *   `user_data` must stay valid until the instance and every object made
 *   from it are destroyed, and by then every block SpudLib took from them
 *   has been freed. Where a module lets an object's memory outlast its
 *   destroy call, its header says until when (a SpudNet resolver whose
 *   lookup is still running).
