/**
 * @defgroup spudinput SpudInput
 * @brief Input devices the platform lets a process read directly, with no
 * window (GameController / GameInput / XInput / evdev): which are
 * connected, what each is, and what state each is in. Gamepads only so far.
 * Known problems: only the GameController, evdev and GameInput backends
 * are written.
 * GameController has read a gamepad held and used on macOS, through a
 * caller polling once a frame (on the process's main thread, which
 * GameController requires): found when connected,
 * both sticks and both triggers read in the directions and ranges stated
 * here, and a button (the left stick, pressed in) read down and up. Its
 * other buttons one by one, the rumble, battery, motion, touch surfaces,
 * lights and labels have not been run. On it, a
 * finger resting exactly on the middle of a touch surface is not seen, a
 * motion sample's time is when it reached the process and not when it was
 * taken, and the direction of the motion axes has not been checked against
 * a device. evdev has found a gamepad and read its properties and its state
 * at rest, and its battery and lights have run only against copies of what
 * drivers put in sysfs; it gives no gamepad motion sensors, touch surfaces
 * or labels; a light usually answers SPUDRESULT_SPUDINPUT_ACCESS_DENIED,
 * since sysfs LEDs are root's to write unless the system says otherwise;
 * and its face buttons are where the kernel driver says they are, which for
 * xpad (Xbox) puts the left face button at SPUDINPUT_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_NORTH
 * and the top one at WEST. GameInput has found an Xbox gamepad and read
 * its properties and its state at rest; it gives no motion sensors, touch
 * surfaces, lights or labels, and no name for that gamepad.
 *
 * A translation of the platform's device API, nothing more.
 *
 * What is not here, and never will be: anything that reaches a process as
 * an event of a window. Key presses, the pointer, the cursor, typed text
 * and input methods belong to whoever owns the window, and SpudLib owns
 * none. A keyboard or a mouse read as a bare device, where a platform
 * allows it, would belong here; none is yet.
 *
 * What is here is left as the platform gives it:
 *
 * - Never picks a device and never numbers players. Every gamepad the
 *   platform presents is listed; which one is whose is the caller's.
 * - Never shapes a value. No dead zone, no response curve, no smoothing and
 *   no key repeat: a stick at rest reads whatever the hardware reads, which
 *   is seldom exactly 0. The only arithmetic is bringing each platform's
 *   range and direction to the one this header states.
 * - Never maps a device the platform doesn't call a gamepad. Each platform
 *   has its own notion of a standard gamepad (GCExtendedGamepad, the
 *   XInput and GameInput gamepad, the Linux kernel's gamepad button and
 *   axis codes), and a device is listed when the platform presents it that
 *   way. There is no table of other devices' layouts here; a joystick or a
 *   wheel the platform shows only as raw buttons and axes is not listed.
 * - Never starts a thread and never calls back. Everything is read when the
 *   caller asks: spudinput_instance_poll() takes what the platform has,
 *   within the call, and the other calls answer from that until the next
 *   poll.
 *
 * The same shape as SpudNet's: names are `spudinput_<object>_<verb>`, an
 * instance is made by its `_create` and released by its `_destroy`, and a
 * desc has no defaults.
 *
 * A gamepad is named by a value, a spudinput_gamepad_id, not by a handle:
 * a device can be unplugged at any moment, and a value that has stopped
 * naming anything is told apart from one that still does, which a pointer
 * could not be.
 *
 * What a gamepad has beyond buttons and axes differs from one device to the
 * next and from one platform to the next, so each such thing is a bit in
 * SPUDINPUT_GAMEPAD_PROPERTIES::features, found when the gamepad is first
 * seen. Asking a gamepad for one it doesn't have is
 * SPUDRESULT_SPUDINPUT_FEATURE_NOT_PRESENT: nothing is quietly left undone.
 *
 * The outputs (rumble, lights) are set and held: a call says how things are
 * to be from now on, and SpudInput keeps no time. How long a motor runs and
 * what pattern it makes are the caller's, by calling again.
 *
 * Not here: haptics beyond motor levels (resisting triggers, played
 * waveforms), a gamepad's speaker and microphone (those are audio
 * endpoints), and any picture of a button.
 *
 * @par Threads
 * The library rule holds (@ref spud_threads "Threads", spudcore.h): an
 * instance is used by one caller at a time, and every call on one of its
 * gamepads is a use of the instance, since a spudinput_gamepad_id is a
 * value and not an object of its own. What is particular to SpudInput is
 * marked `Thread:` where it applies: GameController's poll is confined to
 * the process's main thread, and GameInput may call the instance's
 * allocator on a thread of its own.
