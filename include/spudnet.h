/**
 * @defgroup spudnet SpudNet
 * @brief The platform's network APIs behind one C interface. Known problem:
 * only the Apple backends have been built and run (macOS, against a server on
 * the same machine); the Windows and Linux backends have never been built
 * with their own toolchains and have never run, so what this header says of
 * them is what they were written to do.
 *
 * Three parts, each a translation of what the platform already has:
 *
 * | Part             | Windows  | Linux       | Apple        |
 * |------------------|----------|-------------|--------------|
 * | TCP sockets      | Winsock2 | BSD sockets | BSD sockets  |
 * | HTTP client      | WinHTTP  | libcurl     | NSURLSession |
 * | WebSocket client | WinHTTP  | libcurl (*) | NSURLSession |
 *
 * (*) libcurl 8.11 or later. Against an older one, or one built without
 * WebSocket, spudnet_websocket_create() returns
 * SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED.
 *
 * On Linux all of SpudNet, the TCP sockets included, needs libcurl 7.84 or
 * later, built thread-safe: spudlib doesn't build against an older one, and
 * spudnet_instance_create() returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED on one
 * that isn't thread-safe (@ref spudnet_instances "Instance" has why).
 *
 * Not every part is on every platform: SPUDNET_EXT_TCP and
 * SPUDNET_EXT_WEBSOCKET say which of the first and the last this build has
 * (@ref spudnet_parts "Which parts this build has"). HTTP is on all of them.
 *
 * The HTTP and WebSocket clients don't sit on the TCP sockets here. TLS,
 * proxies and framing belong to the platform's client stack, and they
 * translate that stack directly.
 *
 * Pure transport, no protocol. SpudNet moves bytes, requests and messages
 * and nothing else. Message framing over a socket, what a status code or a
 * payload means, when to retry or reconnect, who has authority - all of
 * that is the caller's, the same way SpudGPU never decides what to draw.
 *
 * The same shape throughout:
 *
 * - Names are `spudnet_<object>_<verb>`: spudnet_tcp_socket_send(),
 *   spudnet_http_client_create(), spudnet_websocket_recv().
 * - Every object is an opaque handle made by its `_create` (a connected
 *   socket also by spudnet_tcp_listener_accept()) and released by its
 *   `_destroy`, which takes NULL and does nothing with it. The caller owns
 *   it in between.
 * - Everything starts from a spudnet_instance
 *   (@ref spudnet_instances "Instance"). The `_create` calls that make an
 *   object from nothing take one; an object made from another object (an
 *   accepted socket, an HTTP transfer) is its parent's instance's. There is
 *   nothing to call once per process.
 * - Anything with more than a couple of inputs takes a desc struct.
 *   Nothing in one has a default: SpudNet never picks an address, a port, a
 *   backlog, a time limit or a size limit for the caller.
 * - Strings and buffers passed in are only read during the call.
 * - Every call returns at once or blocks the thread it was made on; SpudNet
 *   starts no thread and has no non-blocking mode
 *   (@ref spudnet_threads "Threads"). A call that can wait takes a time
 *   limit (@ref spudnet_time "Time limits") and can be ended from another
 *   thread by the object's `_abort` (@ref spudnet_aborting "Aborting").
 * - Failures are SPUDRESULT values: the general ones, and the
 *   `SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_*` group in spudcore.h. What the platform itself
 *   reported behind one is kept and can be read back
 *   (@ref spudnet_error_detail "Error detail").
 */

/**
 * @defgroup spudnet_parts Which parts this build has
 * @ingroup spudnet
 * @brief Compile-time macros that say whether this build has TCP sockets and
 * the WebSocket client.
 *
 * spudlib is built for one platform at a time, and the build says which by
 * defining one of SPUDLIB_PLATFORM_WIN32, SPUDLIB_PLATFORM_LINUX and
 * SPUDLIB_PLATFORM_APPLE as 1. The last covers every Apple system, and
 * SpudNet has to tell one of them apart, so a build for Apple Watch also
 * defines SPUDLIB_PLATFORM_WATCHOS as 1. Anything not defined is 0.
 *
 * Each of SPUDNET_EXT_TCP and SPUDNET_EXT_WEBSOCKET is 1 where the platform
 * lets an ordinary application use that part and 0 where it doesn't, and
 * everything belonging to a part is declared only when its macro is 1 - so
 * code that uses a part the platform doesn't have fails to compile there,
 * rather than building and then failing on the device. Code that is shared
 * between platforms tests the macro, and never a platform's name: if a
 * second platform comes to lack a part, that is one line changed here and
 * nothing to hunt for anywhere else.
 *
 * | Platform                 | TCP | WebSocket |
 * |--------------------------|-----|-----------|
 * | Windows                  | 1   | 1         |
 * | Linux                    | 1   | 1 (*)     |
 * | Apple other than watchOS | 1   | 1         |
 * | watchOS                  | 0   | 0         |
 *
 * (*) The macro says the platform has it. Whether the libcurl spudlib was
 * built against does is found out when spudnet_websocket_create() is called
 * (SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED).
 *
 * watchOS: everything below HTTP is closed to most applications there.
 * BSD sockets and NSURLSession's WebSocket task both exist in its SDK, so
 * code that uses them compiles, and both are refused when the application
 * runs; the system only lets them through for a few kinds of application
 * (one streaming audio, chiefly). What an ordinary application has is
 * HTTP, which is what is left here. 0 is therefore a statement about what
 * the system allows rather than about what SpudNet has written, and it
 * shuts out the excepted kinds of application along with the rest.

/**
 * @defgroup spudnet_threads Threads
 * @ingroup spudnet
 * @brief Every thread is the caller's: SpudNet starts none and calls nothing
 * back.
 *
 * - SpudNet starts no thread. A call runs on the thread that made it, for
 *   as long as it takes or its time limit allows. Where work has to go on
 *   while the caller does something else, the caller brings the thread:
 *   how many there are, what they cost and when they end is not SpudNet's
 *   to decide. (The platform's HTTP stack has threads of its own. They are
 *   the stack's, and nothing of the caller's ever runs on them.)
 * - Nothing here calls back. No function pointer is taken anywhere in this
 *   header, so no code of the caller's runs anywhere but where the caller
 *   called from.
 * - No object belongs to a thread. Any thread may use one, and a different
 *   thread next time; what each object limits is how many may be inside it
 *   at once, and its own section says so (one receiver and one sender on a
 *   socket, one thread on an HTTP transfer, one on a wait set).
 * - The calls that may come from any thread at any time are the ones that
 *   end a wait - every `_abort`, and spudnet_wait_set_wake() - and no others
 *   (@ref spudnet_aborting "Aborting", and @ref spudnet_wait "Wait set").
 * - Taking an object apart is always the same three steps: abort it, wait
 *   for the caller's own threads to come back out of it, destroy it. The
 *   one exception is the resolver, whose lookup can't be brought back and
 *   whose destroy is made not to need it
 *   (@ref spudnet_resolvers "Resolver").

/**
 * @defgroup spudnet_error_detail Error detail
 * @ingroup spudnet
 * @brief What the platform reported behind a failed call. Known problems:
 * not every failure from a stack leaves a record (libcurl being unable to
 * apply a TLS option, and a WinHTTP close frame that couldn't be sent, leave
 * none); WinHTTP's own certificate complaints all come back as the one code
 * 12175 (ERROR_WINHTTP_SECURE_FAILURE), without which check failed; and the
 * `_get_error` calls take no lock, relying on the calling rule below.
 *
 * A SPUDRESULT is the same on every platform, which is its use and its
 * limit: a network failure has its cause on another machine, may not happen
 * twice, and the one number that says what it was is the platform's own.
 * Each object keeps that number for its most recent failure, and its
 * `_get_error` hands it over. It is for a log or a report; what to do next is
 * decided from the SPUDRESULT, which is why nothing here is portable.
 *
 * What is kept, and when:
 *
 * - Only a failure that came from the platform is recorded. A refused
 *   argument, SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT and SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_ABORTED
 *   are SpudNet's own doing and leave what was there alone - so does a
 *   call that succeeds. A loop polling with SPUDNET_NO_WAIT doesn't wear
 *   the record of a real failure away.
 * - `result` is the SPUDRESULT the recorded call returned. A caller that
 *   just got a failure compares the two to know the detail is that call's
 *   and not an older one's.
 * - A TCP socket and a WebSocket keep two records, because one thread may
 *   be sending while another receives: SPUDNET_ERROR_SIDE says which.
 * - `_get_error` is called under the same rule as the calls it reports on -
 *   by the thread that made the failed call, or one that knows that thread
 *   is not in such a call now. It never waits, and it takes NULL (the
 *   record comes back empty).
 *
 * A call that fails without leaving an object to ask -
 * spudnet_instance_create(), spudnet_get_local_ipv4_addresses(),
 * spudnet_tcp_listener_create() - takes an `out_error` instead, which may be
 * NULL. The other `_create` calls fail only for want of memory or over a bad
 * desc, and take none.

/**
 * @defgroup spudnet_instances Instance
 * @ingroup spudnet
 * @brief Where all three parts start: the platform's networking, started and
 * held by a caller. Known problems: on Linux the libcurl 7.84 floor shuts
 * out distributions that ship an older one (Ubuntu 22.04 and RHEL 9 are
 * believed to), TCP sockets included, since the instance is where libcurl
 * starts; the Linux backend holds one static lock around libcurl's start,
 * the one piece of state SpudNet has; and that several instances can be made
 * and destroyed independently on Windows and Linux rests on Winsock's and
 * libcurl's documented start counts, which has not been tried.
 *
 * Two of the platforms have something to start before their networking
 * can be used and to stop when it is done with: Winsock (WSAStartup,
 * WSACleanup) and libcurl (its global init and cleanup). On Apple there is
 * nothing. A spudnet_instance is that start held by a caller: creating one
 * makes the platform's call, destroying it makes the matching one, and
 * every object in this header is made, directly or through its parent,
 * with an instance that outlasts it.
 *
 * - There is no call to make once per process, and no moment that has to
 *   come before the process's other threads. A part of a program that
 *   uses SpudNet makes an instance of its own and need not know whether
 *   any other part has one.
 * - Any number of instances may exist at once. The platform counts its
 *   starts and keeps its networking up until the last is given back;
 *   SpudNet itself keeps no count, and no state of its own beyond the
 *   Linux backend's lock named above.
 * - spudnet_instance_create() and spudnet_instance_destroy() may be called
 *   from any thread, at the same time as each other and as any other call
 *   in this header - on other instances. On one instance they are like any
 *   other object's: nothing else is in it while it is destroyed.
 * - An instance is destroyed after every object made with it. One
 *   destroyed sooner is the caller's mistake and isn't caught. The one
 *   object that may still be at work is a resolver whose lookup hasn't
 *   returned: it has been destroyed as far as the caller is concerned, and
 *   it holds the platform's networking for itself until it is done
 *   (@ref spudnet_resolvers "Resolver").
 * - Objects are used with others of their own instance: a wait set takes
 *   members made with the instance it was made with, and refuses any other
 *   (SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_INVALID_INSTANCE).
 * - A NULL instance given to a `_create` is
 *   SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_INVALID_INSTANCE.
 *
 * libcurl. Its global init is only safe to make while other threads are
 * running since 7.84, and only in a libcurl built thread-safe (it says so
 * itself: CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE). An instance that may be made at any
 * time, by a part of the program that doesn't know what the rest is doing,
 * needs exactly that, so SpudNet requires it rather than pass the old rule
 * on to its callers: spudlib builds against libcurl 7.84 or later only,
 * and spudnet_instance_create() returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED when
 * the libcurl it finds at run time isn't thread-safe. Nothing of SpudNet

 * during a wait changes its length; SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_SYSTEM_TIMED_OUT and
 * SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_STACK_TIMED_OUT have not yet been seen from any
 * backend, since nothing has been run against a host that never answers.
 *
 * It is the longest the whole call may take, in milliseconds, counted by
 * SpudNet from the moment the call is made: for a call with several stages
 * (connecting, TLS, sending, receiving) all of them come out of the one
 * allowance. The platforms' own timers - which differ: per stage, per idle
 * stretch, whole seconds - are switched off wherever they can be, and never
 * used to keep the caller's limit. A call that runs out returns
 * SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT, and that result means this and nothing
 * else: the limit the caller gave is what ended the call.
 *
 * SPUDNET_NO_WAIT (0) means the call may not wait at all. It does whatever
 * can be done on the spot and returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT if that
 * is nothing:
 *
 * - spudnet_tcp_socket_recv(), spudnet_websocket_recv() and
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_recv() hand over what has already arrived;
 *   spudnet_tcp_listener_accept(), a connection already waiting;
 *   spudnet_http_transfer_receive_response(), a response that has already
 *   come.
 * - spudnet_tcp_socket_send() and spudnet_http_transfer_send() send as much
 *   as will be taken right now.
 * - The calls that can't finish without the other side answering -
 *   spudnet_tcp_socket_connect(), spudnet_http_transfer_start(),
 *   spudnet_websocket_connect(), and spudnet_websocket_send() (a message
 *   half sent can't be taken back) - do nothing, change nothing and return
 *   SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT.
 *
 * This is what replaces a non-blocking mode: a loop that can't stall (a
 * frame loop) passes SPUDNET_NO_WAIT.
 *
 * SPUDNET_WAIT_FOREVER means SpudNet sets no limit. The call still ends
 * when the network does - the operating system gives up on a connection
 * that never answers, a peer closes - or when it is aborted. It never
 * returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT.
 *
 * @par Somebody else's timer
 * SpudNet's clock is not the only one running: under every call there is
 * the operating system, which stops waiting for a peer that has gone
 * silent, and under the HTTP and WebSocket calls there is the client stack
 * as well. When one of those gives up first - with time still left on the
 * caller's limit, or with no limit at all - it is not the caller's limit
 * that ran out, and the call says so with a result of its own, by which
 * part it was made on:
 *
 * - SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_SYSTEM_TIMED_OUT from a TCP socket call. The
 *   operating system gave up on the other end: a connect nobody answered (a
 *   minute or so, by the system's own settings), or an established
 *   connection whose peer stopped acknowledging.
 * - SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_STACK_TIMED_OUT from an HTTP transfer or a WebSocket
 *   call. The stack reported a time-out: its own, or the system's passed
 *   up - the stacks don't reliably say which, so both come back as this
 *   one.
 *
 * Either is a failure like any other from the network: the connection or
 * the request is over, only destroy is left, and the object's `_get_error`
 * has the platform's own code for it. What they add is a difference a
 * caller can act on. "Nobody answered" is usually worth another attempt in
 * a way that "refused" (SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_CONNECT_FAILED) or a turned-away
 * certificate is not - and neither means the caller should have waited
 * longer, which is what SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT is left to mean.
 *
 * How long somebody else's timer runs is not SpudNet's to set, and it is
 * not the same everywhere. Where a stack's timer can't be switched off it
 * is set as long as the stack accepts, which is the ceiling on a call made
 * with SPUDNET_WAIT_FOREVER:
 *
 * | Part                          | Longest a call can wait               |
 * |-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
 * | TCP sockets                   | no ceiling; the system's own patience |
 * | HTTP, WebSocket: WinHTTP      | no ceiling; its timers switch off     |
 * | HTTP, WebSocket: libcurl      | about 25 days, while connecting only  |
 * | HTTP, WebSocket: NSURLSession | one year, for a transfer or a socket  |

/**
 * @defgroup spudnet_tcp TCP sockets
 * @ingroup spudnet
 * @brief Winsock2 / BSD sockets: plain TCP over IPv4 or IPv6, no TLS. Known
 * problems: there is no keep-alive option, no local address for an outgoing
 * connection, no query for a socket's own local address and no UDP; and TCP
 * differs from the WebSocket client in two ways a caller has to remember:
 * its send is partial where a WebSocket's is a whole message, and the end of
 * a connection is 0 bytes with SPUD_SUCCESS here and
 * SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_WS_CLOSED there.
 *
 * A translation of the platform socket API (bind/listen/accept/connect/
 * send/recv), not a networking framework. Anything that has to be private
 * or authenticated goes through the HTTP or WebSocket client further down.
 *
 * Two objects. A spudnet_tcp_listener waits for incoming connections on one
 * address and port. A spudnet_tcp_socket is one connection, made either by
 * spudnet_tcp_listener_accept() or by spudnet_tcp_socket_create() followed
 * by one spudnet_tcp_socket_connect(). A socket is good for one connection:
 * after connect fails, or the connection ends, only destroy is left.
 *
 * Addresses are numeric: "192.168.1.20", "127.0.0.1", `"::1"`. The calls
 * that take one never look a name up, because the system's lookup can be
 * neither given a time limit nor interrupted, and a connect that hid one
 * couldn't keep its own. Turning a host name into addresses is its own
 * object, the spudnet_resolver, and which of the answers to use is the
 * caller's to choose.
 *
 * send and recv mirror the underlying socket calls: either can transfer
 * fewer bytes than asked for. A caller that wants "exactly N bytes or
 * nothing" loops on these itself; SpudNet won't do it for you.
 *
 * Threads: on one socket, one thread may be in spudnet_tcp_socket_recv()
 * while another is in spudnet_tcp_socket_send(). Two receivers at once or
 * two senders at once are the caller's to prevent, as is more than one
 * thread in spudnet_tcp_listener_accept() on one listener.

 * @defgroup spudnet_resolvers Resolver
 * @ingroup spudnet_tcp
 * @brief A host name's addresses, from the operating system's resolver.
 * Known problems: a resolver that is created and destroyed without ever
 * being run is leaked, so every one must be run; and only Windows can stop a
 * lookup that is in progress - on Linux and Apple the thread in
 * spudnet_resolver_run() comes back when the system's getaddrinfo does,
 * however long ago the caller stopped waiting.
 *
 * The system's lookup (getaddrinfo) blocks for as long as it takes -
 * usually milliseconds, up to its own give-up time when a name server
 * isn't answering - and on most platforms nothing can make it return
 * sooner. A time limit and an abort can therefore only be had by not being
 * the thread that is stuck in it. So a lookup here is two calls, meant for
 * two threads, and both threads are the caller's
 * (@ref spudnet_threads "Threads"):
 *
 * - spudnet_resolver_run() does the lookup. It blocks until the system has
 *   answered and keeps the answer in the resolver. It goes on a thread the
 *   caller can afford to leave in there.
 * - spudnet_resolver_wait() waits for that answer, with a time limit and an
 *   abort like every other wait in this header, and copies it out. It goes
 *   on the thread that wants the addresses.
 *
 * What SpudNet adds is the part in between that is easy to get wrong: the
 * answer has to be somewhere both threads can reach and neither can pull
 * out from under the other, whichever finishes first. That is the
 * resolver. It stays until both of two things have happened, in either
 * order: its run has returned, and it has been destroyed. A waiter that
 * gives up destroys it and walks away while the lookup is still out; a
 * lookup that finishes first leaves the answer for the waiter. So:
 *
 * @warning Every resolver is run exactly once and destroyed exactly once.
 *
 * A resolver that turns out not to be needed - the thread for it couldn't
 * be started - is still run: abort it first and spudnet_resolver_run()
 * returns at once without looking anything up. Then destroy it.
 *
 * A caller with nothing better to do than wait makes both calls on one
 * thread, run and then wait, and has an ordinary blocking lookup.
 *
 * The usual two-thread use:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * spudnet_resolver_create(instance, &desc, &resolver);
 * start_my_thread(lookup_thread, resolver);   // calls spudnet_resolver_run(resolver), nothing else
 * result = spudnet_resolver_wait(resolver, 2000, addresses, 8, &count);
 * spudnet_resolver_destroy(resolver);         // whether or not it timed out
 * // the thread ends by itself when the system resolver lets it go
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par The instance
 * Since the lookup may still be out when the caller has destroyed the
 * resolver and gone on to destroy the instance it was made with, a resolver
 * doesn't lean on the instance's start of the platform's networking: where
 * the lookup needs one (Winsock) it takes one of its own when it is made
 * and gives it back when it is freed. Destroying the instance after the
 * resolver is therefore in order whether or not the lookup has returned.
 *
 * @par Threads
 * One in spudnet_resolver_run(), ever. One at a time in
 * spudnet_resolver_wait() and spudnet_resolver_get_error(), and those have
 * come back before spudnet_resolver_destroy() - the thread in run is the
 * one destroy doesn't wait for. spudnet_resolver_abort() from any thread,
 * but not racing destroy.

 * SO_REUSEADDR nor SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE.
 *
 * When an address and port count as taken, which is the same on every
 * platform:
 *
 * - While a listener holds them, they are taken: a second listener on the
 *   same address and port is SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_ADDRESS_IN_USE, from this
 *   program or another.
 * - Once that listener is destroyed, they are free at once. The system
 *   goes on holding the connections it had accepted for a minute or two
 *   after they close, and left to itself Linux and Apple's systems would
 *   refuse the port for that long - a server that restarts would fail to
 *   come back up. Windows has no such wait, so there is none anywhere:
 *   the others are told not to keep one (SO_REUSEADDR). There is no
 *   setting for it because the strict form can't be had on Windows.
 *
 * And the one case that is not the same, and that a caller should not
 * build on: a port with one listener on every address ("0.0.0.0" or `"::"`)
 * and another on one particular address of the same family ("127.0.0.1").
 *
 * - Linux refuses the second, whichever of the two comes first: a
 *   listener on every address has the port on all of them.
 * - Windows refuses it too.
 * - Apple's systems, like the BSD they come from, allow it. They treat
 *   the two as different addresses, and a connection goes to the listener
 *   whose address fits it most closely - the particular one for that
 *   address, the general one for every other.
 *

/**
 * @defgroup spudnet_stack HTTP and WebSocket
 * @ingroup spudnet
 * @brief What the HTTP and WebSocket clients share: the platform's own client
 * stack (WinHTTP / NSURLSession / libcurl). Known problems: the stack adds
 * its own request headers and which ones differs by platform, which is a
 * choice still made for the caller (NSURLSession adds Host, Accept,
 * Accept-Language, Connection, Accept-Encoding and User-Agent to a plain
 * GET; the other two have not been looked at); and a server that ignores
 * `Accept-Encoding: identity` and compresses anyway is handed over still
 * compressed by libcurl and WinHTTP and decoded by NSURLSession.
 *
 * TLS and HTTP versions are the platform stack's. Which certificates a
 * server may present, and whether a proxy stands between here and it, are
 * the caller's to say, in a spudnet_tls_desc and a spudnet_proxy_desc
 * (@ref spudnet_tls "TLS" and @ref spudnet_proxies "Proxy"). SpudNet
 * carries one request or one message at a time and nothing else: no retry,
 * no redirect unless asked for, no cookies, no stored credentials, no
 * cache, no reconnect, no keep-alive pings of its own. It holds none of the
 * caller's data either: a body, in either direction, passes through in the
 * pieces the caller moves it in, and is never gathered up here. What a
 * status code or a message means is the caller's.
 *
 * The calls here that can wait are spudnet_http_transfer_start(), `_send`,
 * `_receive_response` and `_recv`, and spudnet_websocket_connect(), `_send`
 * and `_recv`; each takes a time limit and can be ended from another
 * thread, as @ref spudnet_time "Time limits" and
 * @ref spudnet_aborting "Aborting" describe. The rest return without
 * waiting on the network. No time limit has a default.
 *
 * @par Host names
 * A URL here names its host, and the stack looks that name up itself -
 * unlike a TCP socket, which is given a numeric address and has the
 * spudnet_resolver to get one. The two differ because what kept the lookup
 * out of spudnet_tcp_socket_connect() doesn't hold here: the stack's lookup
 * is part of the call that needed it, comes out of that call's time limit
 * and ends with its abort. And the stack can't do without the name, which
 * goes to the server in the request and in the TLS handshake and is what
 * the server's certificate is checked against.
 *
 * What the caller doesn't get is the choice a resolver gives: where a name
 * has several addresses, or both an IPv4 and an IPv6 one, which is used is
 * the stack's to pick. A URL may give a numeric address in place of a name
 * (`"http://192.168.1.20:8080/"`, `"http://[::1]/"`), which is then the one
 * used; over TLS the server's certificate has to be for that address, or
 * the spudnet_tls_desc has to say how else the server is known.
 *
 * @par Decoding and the stack's own headers
 * Two things are the stack's and can't be turned off evenly across
 * platforms, so they are the same everywhere instead: a compressed
 * response body arrives decoded, and the stack adds its own standard
 * request headers (Host, Accept-Encoding, on some platforms User-Agent and
 * Accept) where the caller set none.
 *
 * Decoding can't be switched off - NSURLSession has no way to hand over a
 * body still compressed - but compression can be declined, which comes to
 * the same thing and works on every stack. A caller that needs a response
 * body byte for byte as the server holds it sends the request header
 *
 * @code{.unparsed}
 * Accept-Encoding: identity
 * @endcode
 *
 * which tells the server to send it as it is. The stack then sends that
 * in place of its own Accept-Encoding, nothing arrives compressed, and
 * there is nothing to decode. That is what a download wants when it will
 * be resumed (a Range counts bytes as they are sent, so it only lines up
 * with what was received if the two are the same bytes), or checked
 * against a size or a hash somebody published. Everything else - an API
 * reply above all - is better left alone, smaller on the wire and decoded
 * on arrival.
 *
 * `identity` is the one value of Accept-Encoding a caller may send. Any
 * other would have the caller choosing compressions for a decoder it
 * doesn't own, with a result that differs by stack, and is refused
 * (SPUDRESULT_DESC_INVALID_PARAMETERS).
 *
 * @par Results
 * A bad argument is refused before anything is sent: SPUDRESULT_NULL_DESC,
 * SPUDRESULT_NULL_OUTPUT_PARAMETER, SPUDRESULT_DESC_INVALID_PARAMETERS (a
 * missing field, a size limit of 0, a combination the desc's own comments

 * `skip_host_name_check` doesn't reach it; on libcurl a root that isn't a
 * certificate is only found at the first connection, as
 * SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TLS_FAILED, and not when the desc is handed over; on
 * Apple, pins need macOS 12, iOS 15 or watchOS 8, and Apple's own rules for
 * server certificates still apply to a self-signed one given as a root;
 * there are no client certificates, no minimum TLS version, no revocation
 * checking and no way to read back the certificate a server presented; and
 * none of it has been run against a certificate issued by a public
 * authority.
 *
 * One spudnet_tls_desc says it for every https:// or wss:// connection of
 * the object it is given to: an HTTP client takes one when it is created
 * (not per transfer - one that reuses an open connection meets no
 * certificate to check), a WebSocket with its connect desc. It is checked
 * for sense there even when the URL turns out to be http:// or ws://, where
 * it then has nothing to act on.
 *
 * Three questions, answered separately:
 *
 * - `trust`: which roots a certificate chain has to end at.
 * - `skip_host_name_check`: whether the certificate has to be for the host
 *   in the URL.
 * - `pins`: whether the server's own key has to be one of a known few, on
 *   top of whatever the first two let through.
 *
 * A zeroed desc is the stack's own behaviour with nothing added: the system
 * trust store, the host name checked, no pins.
 *
 * A server with a self-signed certificate is reached one of three ways:
 * its certificate given as the one root (SPUDNET_TLS_TRUST_ROOTS - it is
 * its own issuer); SPUDNET_TLS_TRUST_ANY with a pin, which identifies the
 * server by its key alone; or SPUDNET_TLS_TRUST_ANY by itself, which
 * accepts whoever answers and is only for a machine the caller trusts the
 * network path to.
 *
 * A certificate these turn away is SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TLS_FAILED from
 * spudnet_websocket_connect(), or from the HTTP transfer call that was
 * waiting when the connection came up (spudnet_http_transfer_start(), or a
 * later one where the stack connects late), before the request has gone
 * out. A desc that contradicts itself is
 * SPUDRESULT_DESC_INVALID_PARAMETERS from the call it was handed to, as is
 * a root that isn't a certificate (on WinHTTP and NSURLSession; see the
 * known problems above for libcurl). SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_UNSUPPORTED means
 * the stack can't do what was asked - only libcurl can say that, of one
 * built with a TLS library that lacks roots from memory or pinning.
 *
 * What the stack checks apart from these (validity dates, key usage, its
 * own rules for what a server certificate must look like) stays on, except
 * under SPUDNET_TLS_TRUST_ANY. On Apple platforms App Transport Security
 * is a further gate in front of all of it, set in the application's
 * Info.plist and not from here.

 * same machine; an explicit proxy for https:// and wss:// has only been
 * tried on macOS; and what a proxy that wants a login looks like to the
 * caller (below) has not been observed on any stack.
 *
 * One spudnet_proxy_desc says it for every connection of the object it is
 * given to, and it goes where a spudnet_tls_desc goes for the same reason:
 * an HTTP client takes one when it is created (a connection the client is
 * holding open was made by one route and can't be given another), a
 * WebSocket with its connect desc. It covers plain and TLS connections
 * alike.
 *
 * A zeroed desc is the stack's own behaviour with nothing added: whatever
 * proxy the platform is set up to use, which may well be none.
 *
 * What "the platform is set up to use" means is the platform's, and not
 * the same thing on each:
 *
 * - Windows: the user's proxy settings, with automatic detection and
 *   configuration scripts where those are switched on.
 * - Apple: the proxies in the system's network settings, configuration
 *   scripts included.
 * - Linux: the http_proxy, https_proxy, all_proxy and no_proxy environment
 *   variables of this process, which is what libcurl reads. There is no
 *   system-wide setting to read, and a desktop's own (GNOME's, KDE's) is
 *   not looked at.
 *
 * What this doesn't do:
 *
 * - Log in to a proxy. SpudNet keeps no credentials and answers no
 *   authentication challenge, a proxy's included. One that wants a login
 *   shows as a 407 response to a plain HTTP transfer, and as a connection
 *   that fails (SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_CONNECT_FAILED, or the part's
 *   catch-all) to anything over TLS, where the proxy's refusal comes before
 *   there is a response to hand over.
 * - Name anything but an HTTP proxy. SOCKS, a proxy per scheme and a list

/**
 * @defgroup spudnet_http HTTP
 * @ingroup spudnet_stack
 * @brief The HTTP client, for http:// and https://. Known problems: the rule
 * of one transfer at a time per client is enforced on libcurl and
 * NSURLSession but not on WinHTTP, which would carry several and doesn't
 * check; a server's answer that comes before the request body is all sent
 * may be lost (see spudnet_http_transfer_send()); several `Set-Cookie`
 * headers can't be read apart on any platform; and an HTTP transfer can't go
 * in a wait set.
 *
 * Two objects. A spudnet_http_client holds the stack's connections, so
 * that requests to one server reuse them. A spudnet_http_transfer is one
 * request and its response, made on a client.
 *
 * A transfer moves its bodies the way a TCP socket moves bytes: the caller
 * sends the request body in pieces and receives the response body in
 * pieces, each call taking or giving what there is, and nothing is held in
 * between. A file goes up or comes down in a buffer's worth of memory
 * whatever its size, the caller knows how far along it is because it is
 * the one counting, and "how much is too much" is the caller's to decide by
 * no longer asking for more. A caller that wants a small body as one block
 * loops on recv into a buffer of its own; SpudNet won't do it for you.
 *
 * The order of use, each step once and in this order:
 *
 * | Call                                           | What it does                                                                               |
 * |------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | spudnet_http_transfer_create()                 | a transfer, on a client                                                                    |
 * | spudnet_http_transfer_start()                  | the request line and headers                                                               |
 * | spudnet_http_transfer_send()                   | the request body, until all of it is in (skipped when there is none, or none to send)      |
 * | spudnet_http_transfer_receive_response()       | ends the request, waits for the status and headers                                         |
 * | spudnet_http_transfer_get_status(), `_get_header`, ... | reads the status and headers                                                       |
 * | spudnet_http_transfer_recv()                   | the response body, until it returns 0 bytes                                                |
 * | spudnet_http_transfer_destroy()                | ends the transfer and frees it                                                             |
 *
 * A call made out of that order (other than abort, get_error and destroy)
 * returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_INVALID_HTTP_TRANSFER. A transfer is good for
 * one request: after any call on it fails - other than by running out of
 * time where that call's own comment says it may be tried again - only
 * destroy is left.
 *
 * Time limits belong to each call, as everywhere in this header. There is
 * none for the exchange as a whole; a caller that has one keeps it, and
 * passes each call what is left of it.
 *
 * A transfer and its client:
 *
 * - One transfer at a time per client, from its start until it is
 *   destroyed. Transfers that run side by side want a client each.
 * - Destroying a transfer whose response body was received to its end
 *   hands its connection back to the client for the next one. Destroying
 *   it any earlier drops the connection, which is also how a response
 *   nobody wants the rest of is stopped.
 * - A transfer is destroyed before its client.
 *
 * Threads: one at a time in a transfer; it has no sending side and
 * receiving side to share out, since a request is sent before its response
 * is read. spudnet_http_transfer_abort() is the exception, as every
 * `_abort` is.

/**
 * @defgroup spudnet_wait Wait set
 * @ingroup spudnet
 * @brief One thread waiting on many objects. Known problems: it is poll()
 * and not epoll or kqueue, so each wait costs time in proportion to the
 * members - fine for hundreds, not for thousands; an object destroyed while
 * still in a set is not caught, and the set then polls a closed descriptor
 * or asks a freed WebSocket; an HTTP transfer can't be a member; a libcurl
 * WebSocket is not named for a close this side made; and the Windows half
 * (a wake socket under WSAPoll) has never been compiled or run.
 *
 * Every waiting call above waits on one object. A wait set is how one
 * thread waits on several - a server's listener and all its connections -
 * without a thread for each and without circling them with SPUDNET_NO_WAIT.
 * It is the platform's poll() (WSAPoll on Windows) over the objects' own
 * sockets, and it does none of the receiving, accepting or sending itself:
 * spudnet_wait_set_wait() only says which objects are worth calling, and
 * the caller then makes the ordinary calls on them with SPUDNET_NO_WAIT.
 *
 * TCP sockets, TCP listeners and WebSockets can be in one. An HTTP
 * transfer can't.
 *
 * How to use one, which is the same as for epoll or kqueue used carefully:
 *
 * - After spudnet_wait_set_wait() names an object, call it with
 *   SPUDNET_NO_WAIT until it returns SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT, and only
 *   then wait again. A stack can hold more than it had when it woke the
 *   set - a WebSocket hands a message over in parts - and whether the
 *   leftover would be reported a second time differs between them. Draining
 *   is the one rule that is right on all of them.
 * - Being named is a reason to try, not a promise. The first try after a
 *   wake can itself return SPUDRESULT_SPUDNET_TIMED_OUT (libcurl's
 *   WebSocket is always named once after it is added, since what it has
 *   already read can't be asked about), and that is not an error.
 * - An object that has ended - aborted, closed by the peer, broken - is
 *   named too. The call made on it then says which, and the caller removes
 *   it.
 *
 * Whose is what:
 *
 * - The set doesn't own its objects. An object is removed from its set
 *   before it is destroyed; destroying the set first removes whatever is
 *   still in it.
 * - One thread at a time in a set's add, remove, wait and destroy.
 *   spudnet_wait_set_abort() is the exception, as every `_abort` is, and so
 *   is spudnet_wait_set_wake().
 * - While an object is in a set, its receiving side is the waiting
 *   thread's: no other thread is in recv or accept on it. Sending from
 *   another thread carries on as before.
 * - An object goes in one set at a time.
