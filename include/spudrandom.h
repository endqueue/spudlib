/**
 * @file spudrandom.h
 * @brief SpudRandom: the operating system's cryptographically secure
 * random bytes.
 *
 * One call, which asks the operating system for bytes from its own secure
 * generator and returns them. Nothing is seeded, kept or mixed here: there
 * is no generator of SpudLib's, no state and no handle. What source each
 * platform reads:
 *
 * | Platform | Source |
 * |---|---|
 * | Windows | `BCryptGenRandom` with `BCRYPT_USE_SYSTEM_PREFERRED_RNG` |
 * | Linux | `getrandom(2)`, blocking only until the kernel's pool is first ready |
 * | Apple | `getentropy(2)`, 256 bytes a call |
 *
 * @par Threads
 * No call takes an object, so under the library rule (spudcore.h, "Threads")
 * any call may overlap any other.
